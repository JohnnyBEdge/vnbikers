      , was a custom bike shop that was exclusively owned and ran by Westerners. Based in Hanoi,
      it all started with a few friends that loved anything with an engine. Initially renting a space to
      service and customize their own bikes, they used past experience with car builds along with inspiration from custom
      bikes from around the world and decided to offer their services to the expats and locals.
      What set them apart was not only the most original and badass bikes of Hanoi, but also the honesty and
      quality that came with them, a rarity in Vietnam.

    <p> Our Better oil change uses a Semi synthetic blend oil. A mixture of synthetic and conventional oils that serves as a better protection than conventional oil, especially in hard riding conditions, but not as good as our AMSOIL full synthetic oil change. The "Better" includes up to 3 quarts of oil and premium HIFLO oil filter.</p>
    <p>Includes Mount, Balance and Inspection of wheels, spokes, bearings, tubes, valve stems.
      Valve stems and tubes should be replaced when mounting a new Tire. On the bike, we will perform a complimentary 50-point inspection.</p>
